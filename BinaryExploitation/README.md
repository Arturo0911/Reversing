# Introduction to Binary Exploitation.

In this article, we cover over the interesting world about the exploitation
how it's so important to learn and how can we do to take advantage at the moment
to perform buffer overflows, ROP, Rep2Libc and so on.


## Computer Architecture.


    - Cache: Cache memory is usually located within the CPU itself and heance is extremely
             fast compared to RAM, as it runs at the same clock speed as the CPU. However,
             it is very limited in size and very sophisticatedm and expensive to manufacture
             due to it being so close to the CPU core.

                * Level 1 Cache => Usually in KiloByes, the fastest memory available, located 
                                   in each CPU core. (only registers are faster.)
                * Level 2 Cache => Usually in MegaBytes, extremely fast (but slower than L1),
                                   shared between all CPU cores.
                * Level 3 Cache => Usually in MegaBytes (larger that L2), faster than RAM but
                                   slower than L1/L2. (Not all CAPUs use L3)  

    - RAM: RAM is much larger than cache memery, coming in sizes rangin from GigaBytes up to
           TeraBytes; is also located far away from the CPU cores and is much slower than cache
           memory. Accessing data from RAM addresses takes many more instructions.

           For example, retrieving an instruction from the registers takes only one clock cycle,
           and retrieving it from the L1 cache takes a few cylces, while retrieving it from RAM
           takes around 200 cycles.


## Instructions Set Architectures


An Instruction Set Architecture (ISA) Specifies the syntax and semantics of the assembly language
on each architecture. It is not just a different syntax but is built in the copy design of a processor, 
as if affects the way and order instructions are executed and their level of complexity. ISA mainly
consists of the following components:

    - Instructions.
    - Registers.
    - Memory Addresses.
    - Data Types.


Instructions => The instruction to be proccessed in the opcode operand_list format. There are usually 
1,2 or 3 comma-separated operands. => add rax, 1, mov rsp, rax, push rax

Registers => Used to store operands, addresses, or instructions temporally => rax, rsp, rip

Memory Addresses The addresses in whcih data or instructions are stored. May point to memory or 
registers => 	0xffffffffaa8a25ff, 0x44d0, $rax

Data Types => the type of stored data => byte, word, double word




Registers.

As previously mentioned, each CPU core has a set of registers. The registers are the fastest components
in any computer, as they are built within the CPU core. However, registers are very limited in size and
can only hold a few bytes of data at a time. There are many registers in the x86 architecture, but we
will only focus on the ones necessary for learning basic Assembly and essential for futue binary exploitation.

Data Registers                      Pointer Registers
rax                                     rbp
rbx                                     rsp
rcx                                     rip
